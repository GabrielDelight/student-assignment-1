# React Scroll Comparison: Locomotive Scroll vs React Scroll Parallax
Libraries like [Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/) and [React Scroll Parallax](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro) are used to enhance your website's scroll performance. You've probably seen lovely animations that appear while scrolling down a website and then noticed that it responds with effects, a customized speed, rotation, and translating object that takes effect. Both libraries will be compared in-depth in this article, along with their benefits and drawbacks, as well as practical usage.


After giving you a glimpse of the scroll animations you frequently see on websites, this article's primary goal is to compare Locomotive Scroll and React Scroll Parallax for you. I think by the time you've finished reading these articles, you should start using one of these scroll libraries. The two most widely used scrolling libraries, Locomotive Scroll and React Scroll Parallax, are now appropriate for discussion.

# What is Locomotive Scroll?

[Locomotive Scroll](https://locomotivemtl.github.io/locomotive-scroll/) is a JavaScript [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/locomotive-scroll) that creates smooth scrolling effects on web pages.
It enables programmers to produce visual effects where different elements on a page scroll at different rates to give the impression of depth and dimension. The speed at which elements scroll can also be changed, and easing effects can be added.  Locomotive Scroll is a great option because it is lightweight, flexible, and simple to use.

To [animate](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) the scroll position of the page, Locomotive Scroll intercepts the browser's standard scrolling behavior and uses JavaScript. This enables controlled, slick scrolling that can be tailored to produce a range of effects. For parallax effects, where background images move more slowly than the foreground, as well as for other animations like fade-ins and slide-ins, Locomotive Scroll can be used.

The simplicity of Locomotive Scroll's use is one of its main advantages. The library is a popular option for web developers who want to add scrolling effects to their websites without having to write complex code from scratch because it is lightweight and straightforward to implement. With Locomotive Scroll, it's possible to design websites with a polished appearance and enticing scrolling animations that grab users' attention and improve the user experience as a whole.




# What is React Scroll Parallax?

A [React](https://reactjs.org/docs/create-a-new-react-app.html) component called [React Scroll Parallax](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro) gives web pages visual effects. It enables developers to make a scrolling effect where various page elements move at various speeds based on where they are in the view. This enhances the website's overall visual appeal by giving the appearance of depth and dimension.

[React Scroll Parallax](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/intro) offers a wide range of options for developers to modify the scrolling behavior, including the speed and direction of the parallax effect. This component is small, simple to use, and works with the majority of current browsers.

React Scroll Parallax causes various elements to scroll at various rates as the user scrolls down the page by changing the position of the web page's [scroll bar](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Scrollbars). This can be used to produce a variety of effects, such as animated backgrounds, text that fades in and out, and slower-moving foreground images. A website's user experience can be improved by using the [library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-scroll-parallax), which is adaptable and can be used to create a variety of parallax scrolling effects.

# Installation/Setup

Installing and configuring [Locomotive Scroll](https://github.com/locomotivemtl/locomotive-scroll) and [React Scroll Parallax](https://github.com/jscottsmith/react-scroll-parallax) will be covered in this section. These two libraries will be used to build two straightforward websites, and installation is not difficult. The website won't require much work to build, and everything used on it will be clearly explained.


## Locomotive Scroll

Install Locomotive Scroll by running `npm install locomotive-scroll` to get started using it in standard JavaScript. After installing the library, you must configure it using the following code:

     ``` <script src="/node_modules/locomotive-scroll//dist/locomotive-scroll.min.js"></script>
      <script>
        const scroller = new LocomotiveScroll({
          el: document.querySelector("[data-scroll-container]"),
          smooth: true,
        });
      </script>```
      

It's time for you to learn how to use Locomotive Scroll's library now that you have configured it.

Use the `data-scroll-container` attribute to initialize the scrolling effects on your website to enable scroll effects. This is positioned immediately after or within the body element. The `data-scroll` attributes must be present in any element that will have the desired effects.

**More attributes are discussed below:**

- **data-scroll-direction:** this defines the direction of the object for propagation.
- **data-scroll-speed:** this defines the fastness or slowness of the transition. Setting a negative value can make an object move in the opposite direction.
- **data-scroll-class:** this works with the default class name coming from Locomotive Scroll such as appear class which makes an element appear when it reaches the viewpoint.
- **data-scroll-repeat:** to repeat a scroll animation in-view.

## React Scroll Parallax

Installing and configuring React Scroll Parallax is something we'll do in this section. We'll also talk about how to use it to build a basic website in this article.
Run `npm I react-scroll-parallax` in your terminal to install the library. You must import the library into your React application after installation. Use the code below to import the library:


    import { useParallax } from "react-scroll-parallax";

Utilizing React Scroll Parallax comes after the importation. However, let's first go over the library and how to use the component before we begin writing codes.
Using React Scroll Parallax, you can create components with objects like [translate](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/usage/parallax-props#available-css-effects), [scale](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/examples/scroll-effects#scale), [rotate](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/usage/parallax-props#available-css-effects), and adjust [speed](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/usage/components/parallax-component#speed-control).

For the benefit of the website, we'll be using the [Parallax component](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/usage/components/parallax-banner-component), which consists of the objects scaleX, rotatey, translateX, translatey, and easing. An array that is a little complicated to set the direction of the object is given to it as a value. However, in order to learn more about these objects from the Parallax component, you must visit the official docs. But before you go to the website to learn more, take a look at the syntax of a straightforward [scaleX-based](https://react-scroll-parallax.damnthat.tv/docs/usage/parallax-props#available-css-effects) parallax component.


      const scaleCParallax = useParallax({
        scaleX: [0, 3, "easeInQuad"],
      });


Below is an output of the simple web page I created with react-scroll-parallax:

      });
      const parallaxRotateY = useParallax({
        rotateY: [0, 360],
      });
      const parallaxEasing = useParallax({
        easing: "easeOutQuad",
        translateX: [-340, 100],
      });
      const parallaxEasingLeft = useParallax({
        easing: [1, -0.75, 0.5, 1.34],
        translateX: [0, -260],
        translateY: [1100],

# When to Use Either Library

We'll talk about when to use locomotive scrolling and React Scroll Parallax scrolling in this section. For our front-end project, both libraries are crucial, and we need to know when to use each one. Let's get going.


## When to use Locomotive Scroll

Locomotive Scroll is particularly useful for websites with single-page layouts or lengthy pages with numerous sections. Users can easily move between the sections of the content on the page without having to manually scroll through each one.
Furthermore, Locomotive Scroll works wonders for websites that want to add a modern, stylish touch to their design. It can be used to create distinctive scrolling animations that can help capture users' attention and keep them engaged with the page's content.



## When to use React Scroll Parallax

React Scroll Parallax creates the illusion of layers moving at different speeds as the user scrolls through the page, adding depth and dimension to website designs.
React Scroll Parallax is especially useful for websites that want to produce an engaging and visually stunning user experience. It can be used to add a dynamic and interesting element to the design of a website to distinguish it from rival websites.
Additionally, websites should use React Scroll Parallax if they want to tell a compelling story. It can be used to create a seamless transition from one area of the page to another, giving the impression that the story is continuing.





# Locomotive Scroll Vs React Scroll Parallax: Who wins?

There is no contest between Locomotive Scroll and React Scroll Parallax as to which will prevail. Both libraries are effective resources for building interesting and visually appealing websites, and each has a unique set of features and advantages.
Depending on the particular requirements of the project, Locomotive Scroll or React Scroll Parallax should be chosen. React Scroll Parallax may be a better option if you are building a React application and want to add parallax scrolling effects. Locomotive Scroll might be a better choice if you want a standalone library and need more control over the scrolling experience.



# Conclusion

Between Locomotive Scroll and React Scroll Parallax, there is no clear winner because each has pros and cons. The best choice will depend on your level of programming expertise and the goals of your project. Both tools might be appropriate to use if you know JavaScript well.
