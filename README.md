## Logic Assesment

1. const playlist = ['life breath','change','lion king','Alive','Hallelujah', 'victory']
using the array above write a program that can alert the elements at random when the page is refreshed, if it alerts lion king then let the program request for the player's name , and finally alert his name with a winning price of 100 US dollars (eg congratulations Joseph you have won 100 US Dollars)

2. using the console, write a program that can generate random numbers from 1-6, like a ludo game, when the player gets a double six, the program will ask for the username, and with his name congratulates him for winning a double six, eg(congratulations Micheal you have gotten a Double Six)
